Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operation and maintenance of software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): Emphasized the use of structured control flow constructs like loops and conditionals, improving code readability and maintainability.
Development of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Introduced concepts like classes and objects, promoting code reuse and modularity.
Agile Manifesto (2001): Revolutionized software development with principles focusing on iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: Define project goals, scope and feasibility.
Requirements Analysis: Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.
Design: Create architectural and detailed design documents.
Development: Write and compile the source code.
Testing: Verify that the software meets requirements and is free of defects.
Deployment: Release the software to users.
Maintenance: Perform ongoing support and updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall - Each phase must be completed before the next begins. Example: Projects with well-defined requirements and low likelihood of changes like construction projects.
Agile - Work is divided into small, manageable units called sprints. Example: Projects with evolving requirements and a need for flexibility like software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - write, maintain, implement and debug code.
QA Engineer - perform tests to ensure software quality.
Project Manager- plan, execute and close projects ensuring the goals are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE - provides tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g PyCharm
VCS -track code changes and manage versions e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Keeping up with technology - Embrace continous learning.
Ensuring quality - carry out testing and code reviews.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components for correctness.
Integration Testing: Ensures that combined components work together.
System Testing: Validates the complete and integrated software.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the act of giving computers specific, clear, and concise instructions to get your required answers.
It is important for obtaining accurate and relevant responses from AI systems, enhancing their usability and performance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt - "Tell me about Technology"
Improve prompt - "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on modern healthcare, including examples of its applications and benefits"

The improved prompt is specific, clear, and concise leading to more focused and informative responses
